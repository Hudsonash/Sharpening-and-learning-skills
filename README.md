# Self-Tutorials

### Purpose
The purpose of the self-tutorial repository is to give myself beginner and intermediate lessons across a wide variety of languages and modules.  

### Completed Tutorials
* Learning GitHub Basics
* Learning Markdown and Latex

All tutorials will never truly be finished, as I will add more to the notebook as I learn new features and methods.

### Tutorials in Progress
* Learning Basic Pandas (will never be complete, so much to learn in Pandas)
* Python Basics
* Learning Python Classes

### Future Tutorials
* Introduction to SQL Syntax and Python
* Introduction to tensorflow
* Introduction to R Syntax
* Matplotlib: bar and histograms
* Matplotlib: Line graphs
* Introduction to Javascript and D3
* Web scraping sports data
* Importing JSON, XML, CSV, and others to Pandas

I am always striving to improve.  This is a continuously updating repository and I hope to be able to complete many more of these tutorials to further my own personal learning.
